              Trazo is a tool that lets vendors build their own store. It is
              not a marketplace, and it does not hold your money. When you
              buy from a vendor, you are trusting that vendor directly —
              not Trazo. Section 2 explains this fully.
            </p>

            <p>
              Trazo is a <strong>technology platform</strong> that provides
              tools for individuals and businesses (&ldquo;Vendors&rdquo;)
              to build and operate their own online storefronts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Trazo is not a marketplace.</strong> This distinction
              matters and you should understand it before using the
              platform:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Trazo does <strong>not</strong> buy, sell, hold, inspect, or
                take ownership of any goods listed by Vendors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trazo does <strong>not</strong> process, hold, or have
                custody of payments made between Vendors and Customers,
                unless explicitly stated otherwise for a specific feature
                (e.g., a future escrow service).
              </li>
              <li>
                Trazo does <strong>not</strong> vet, background-check, or
                guarantee the identity, legitimacy, honesty, or reliability
                of any Vendor, unless a storefront is explicitly marked
                &ldquo;Verified by Trazo&rdquo; under Section 5.
              </li>
              <li>
                Every transaction conducted through a Trazo storefront is a{" "}
                <strong>
                  direct transaction between the Vendor and the Customer
                </strong>
                . Trazo is not a party to that transaction.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>By using Trazo, you acknowledge and accept this structure.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section id="assumption-of-risk" title="2. Assumption of Risk">
            <p>
              <strong>
                This section states plainly what you are agreeing to.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Trazo enables Vendors to independently list products,
              communicate pricing, and receive payment directly from
              Customers (including via bank transfer, direct payment links,
              or other methods arranged outside the Trazo platform).
              Because Trazo does not control these transactions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There is a real risk that a Vendor may misrepresent goods,
                fail to deliver goods after payment, or act fraudulently.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trazo <strong>does not guarantee</strong> that any Vendor
                will deliver goods paid for, that goods will match their
                description, or that any transaction will be completed as
                agreed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Customers who choose to pay a Vendor directly (e.g., via
                bank transfer) do so{" "}
                <strong>at their own discretion and risk</strong>, in the
                same way they would when buying from any independent seller
                on social media, classifieds, or a personal website.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>If you are a Customer:</strong> only pay Vendors you
              have reasonable confidence in, prefer Vendors marked
              &ldquo;Verified by Trazo&rdquo; where available, and
              understand that Trazo cannot reverse a bank transfer or force
              a Vendor to deliver.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>If you are a Vendor:</strong> you are solely and fully
              responsible for fulfilling every order you receive. Fraud,
              non-delivery, or misrepresentation may result in immediate
              termination of your account and may expose you to civil or
              criminal liability under applicable law — this is between you
              and the affected Customer, not Trazo.

          <Section id="vendor-obligations" title="3. Vendor Obligations">

              <li>
                Not use Trazo to collect payment for goods or services with

            <p>
              By purchasing from any Vendor through a Trazo storefront, the
              Customer acknowledges:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They are transacting{" "}

              </li>
              <li>
                Trazo has not guaranteed the Vendor&rsquo;s legitimacy
                unless explicitly marked &ldquo;Verified&rdquo; (see Section
                5), and even then, verification has limits.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any dispute regarding payment, delivery, product quality, or
                refunds is between the Customer and the Vendor.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trazo provides a reporting mechanism (Section 6) as a
                courtesy and safety measure, not as a guarantee of
                resolution, refund, or compensation.

              Trazo may, at its discretion, offer a &ldquo;Verified by
              Trazo&rdquo; badge to certain Vendors.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What verification means:</strong> Trazo has taken
              reasonable steps to confirm the Vendor is a real, contactable
              person or business (for example, phone number confirmation or
              ID check).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What verification does not mean:</strong>{" "}
              Verification is not a guarantee of honesty, financial
              trustworthiness, product quality, or delivery. It does not
              make Trazo a guarantor or insurer of the transaction. Trazo
              reserves the right to revoke a Vendor&rsquo;s verified status
              at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unverified storefronts will be labeled as such, and Customers
              are encouraged to exercise additional caution when
              transacting with unverified Vendors.

                transaction), and does not act as a dispute-resolution
